# Travel Buddy
Coding Bootcamp Project 2
## Description
Travel Buddy is a road trip app that allows people to plan their road trip in advance. The user can enter their stops along the way, and then be shown maps of each stop. They will also be given hotel information in each of the cities they select. This will enable the user to book their hotels at each city they plan to stop at in advance, ensuring a peaceful road trip.
## Motivation
There is a need for people to be able to quickly plan their route of travel and find hotels to compare and select from at each stopping point.
